# Simple Machines
![source: wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Six_Mechanical_Powers.png)
In physics, a *simple machine* is a device that changes the direction or magnitude of a force. There are generally considered to be six simple machines: lever, wheel, pulley, inclined plane, wedge, and screw. these can be thought of as the "building blocks" from which more complex machines are constructed. Simple machines amplify force by creating *mechanical advantage*. In this wiki page, I will provide a brief description of 2 varieties of simple machines.

## Lever
A lever consists of a beam fixed on a fulcrum. They can be used to exert a large force (resistance) over a small distance on one end by exerting a small force (effort) over a larger distance on the other end, thereby creating mechanical advantage by trading off force against movement. Archeological evidence suggests that levers have been in use as early as 5000 BC. There are three classes of levers distinguished by the relative positions of the fulcrum, effort, and resistance. 
 
## Wheel and Axle 
A wheel and axle consists of a larger cyliner (wheel) mounted on another cocentric cylinder with a smaller diameter (axle). The two parts are able to revolve around the same axis. Mechanical advantage is achieved by applying a tangential force to the wheel, enabling a larger force to be exerted upon a load attached to the axle. One of the earliest known applications of the wheel and axle is the potters wheel, in use in the Middle East since approximately 5000 BC.
